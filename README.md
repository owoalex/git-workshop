=================

To get a local copy of this repository (called "cloning" in git terms), run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/abersailbot/bottleboat-groups.git

To make changes, edit this file and add your name in your team's section. You
then need to make git know about your changes. After you have added your name,
run

    $ git add README.md

This adds your changes to something similar to a staging area, ready to be
committed to the main repository.

This should be followed shortly by a `commit`:

    $ git commit

A text editor should appear, in which you should add a message to your commit.
This message should describe briefly what the commit is, and why it was made.
Your commit to this repository is simple and the purpose is known, so a short
message such as `Add name to bottleboat group` will suffice.
